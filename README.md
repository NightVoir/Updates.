# Updates.
This is what I'm currently working on day-to-day, week by week.
<p>I'm here because I want to add my thoughts and see where this goes.<p>
<p> I'm currently making the transition from working in media, did different asepects; production, videography, audio engineering, video editing for software products and documentation and now I'm making the plunge into just software documentation.</p>
<p> When I'm not working I'm learning how to code. I just started learning Python literally a few days ago! That's exciting! I mean I think its cool how all the commands use print.</p>
<p>Its pretty different from Javascript, HTML and CSS. I have a little, tad expereince with those and XML markup.</p>
<p>All technical stuff aside, who am I and what do I like to do?</p>
<P>I'm a writer! A sci-fi fantasy writer! I read a ton of sci-fi fantasy, The Stormlight Archive is huge for me, currently reading the Wheel of Time, on book 5 "The Fires of Heaven" and I love manga, comics and anime. Invincible is my favorite comic and Image is my favorite distributor!</p>
<h1>Writing and why</h1>
<p>I've been drawn to storytelling since I was around 5 or so. Also, pardon if this is all over the place</p>
<h1>Writing fiction, poetry, and now documentation</h1>
<h1>Music. Tycho, Com Truise, Shigeto, classical</h1>
